# ðŸŽ¯ PostDetail Implementation Summary

## âœ… What Was Implemented

### 1. **New PostDetail Screen** (`app/PostDetail.tsx`)
- Full-screen post view with complete content
- User information display (avatar, name, credentials)
- Interactive action buttons (upvote, comment, share, fact-check, bookmark)
- Comments section with sample comments
- Media support (images and videos)
- Clean header with back navigation

### 2. **Navigation Integration**
- Added PostDetail to navigation stack in `_layout.tsx`
- Modal presentation for better UX
- Parameter passing (postId) between screens

### 3. **Mockfeed Enhancement** (`app/screenComponents/Mockfeed.tsx`)
- Modified "Read More" button to navigate to PostDetail
- Added `handleReadMore` function for navigation
- Preserved all existing functionality

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User sees truncated post in feed
2. Taps "Read More" button
3. PostDetail screen opens as modal
4. User can read full content and interact
5. User taps back button to return to feed

### Technical Flow:
1. `handleReadMore(post)` called in Mockfeed
2. `router.push()` navigates to PostDetail with postId
3. PostDetail receives postId via `useLocalSearchParams()`
4. Post data fetched from mock data
5. Full-screen UI rendered with complete content
